#AB.TK

![AB.TK](https://i.imgur.com/Sw8G5IV.jpg)

A universal TK PCB designed and distributed by Reddit/Geekhack user u/niceandcreamy. Alernatively known as the Creamy AB.TK PCB. From what I have gathered, this was a custom pcb designed for use in TKLs such as the TX-84/87 and similar Korean custom boards circa 2018. This was well known enough to be added to the TKL compatibility list, but it appears to have not been distributed widely beyond certain community members and customers of Creamy's keyboard.care business.

This version is based on a kbfirmware json created by creamy as part of their initial rollout of prototypes. It is based on a json generously provided by Discord user badnews. It appears this pcb never entered widespread distribution, so this will likely stay on a personal repo unless distribution is greater than originally thought.
